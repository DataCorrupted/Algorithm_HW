\textbf{Claim 1} Such $h$ always exists for a tree.
\begin{proof}
	Proof by induction.\\
	1 node tree $T_1$: $h(v) = 1$. proved.\\
	n node tree $T_n$: suppose there is a function $h$.\\
	n+1 node tree $T_{n+1}$: take a leaf node $v$. We can form a $h$ without $v$ since $T_{n+1}/v = T_{n}$. Then we extend $h$: \\
		if $(v, v.parent)$ is odd, $h(v) = h(v.parent)$, else $h(v) = 1 - h(v.parent)$
\end{proof}.\\
\textbf{Claim 2a}: If $h(s) \neq h(t)$, any path from $s$ to $t$ contains odd numbers of even edges.\\
\textbf{Claim 2b}: If $h(s) = h(t)$, any path from $s$ to $t$ contains even numbers of even edges.
\begin{proof}
	Proof by induction \\
	Path with 1 edge. \\
	$h(s) \neq h(t)$, the edge must be even. One(odd) even edge present. \\
	$h(s)   =  h(t)$, the edge must be odd. No(even) even edge present. \\
	Path with n edges. Suppose this is true.
	Path n+1 edges. \\
	take $t$ out and examine $t.parent$. The path from $s$ to $t.parent$ has n edges.\\
	Claim 2a: When $h(s) \neq h(t)$: \\
	$h(s) = h(t.parent) \neq h(t)$, Even + 1(Odd) even edges present.\\
	$h(s) = h(t) \neq h(t.parent)$, Odd + 0(Odd) even edges present.\\
	Claim 2b: When $h(s) = h(t)$: \\
	$h(s) = h(t.parent) = h(t)$, Even + 0(Even) even edges present.\\
	$h(s) = h(t) \neq h(t.parent) $, Odd + 1(Even) even edges present.
\end{proof}
Now let's proof that $\exists h$ when $G$ has no odd number of even weight edge.
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $G = (V, E) = (V, T + S)$ where $(V, T)$ is a span tree of $G$. According to claim 1 $\exists h$ for span tree $(V, T)$. All we need to do is to proof that this $h$ is valid for $G$. To be more precise, $h$ is valid $\forall s = (u, v) \in S$\\
	Case 1: if $h(u) = h(v)$ and $s$ is odd, then $h$ is still valid. \\
	Case 2: if $h(u) \neq h(v)$ and $s$ is even, then $h$ is still valid. \\
	Case 3: if $h(u) = h(v)$ and $s$ is even, then a path from $u$ to $v$ already have even number of even edges, adding one more even edge $s$ will lead to a circle with odd number of even edges, which is not possible. \\
	Case 4: if $h(u) \neq h(v)$ and $s$ is odd, then a path from $u$ to $v$ already have odd number of even edges, with $s$ being odd we have a circle with odd number of even edges, which, again, is not possible. \\

\end{proof}

def bfs(s, V , E)
    queue = s
    dist = {s: 0}
    i = 0; j = 0;
    while i <= j:
        curr = queue[i]; i += 1;
        while (v, curr) in E and (not v in dist):
            dist[v] = dist[curr] + E[(curr, v)]
            j += 1; queue[j] = v;

\par \textbf{Time Complexity} DFS on a graph runs on $O(|E| + |V|)$, since in this case the graph is a tree: $O(|E|) = O(|V|) = O(n)$. Thus two times dfs runs in:
$$T(n) = O(n) = O(n^2) = O(n^3)$$
\par \textbf{Proof of correctness} 
\par \textbf{Claim} assume path $ P = \{s, \cdots, v_i, \cdots, t\}$ is the longest path in the tree, a dfs for longest path starting from $\forall v$ in the tree ends at node $v_e$. We have $v_e \in \{s, t\}$
\begin{proof}. \\
    \textbf{Case 1}: $v \in P$, then this claim is true. 
    \par Suppose not, $d(u, v_e) > d(u, t), d(u, v_e) > d(u, s)$, then $d(s, t)$ is not the longest path, contradiction. \\
    \textbf{Case 2}: $v \notin P$ \\
    	Case I, from $u$ to $v_e$ there is a crossing $x \in P$ with $s$ to $t$, then we fall into Case i.
    	Case II, $\{u \cdots v_e \}$ is disjoint with $P$, then $dis(u, v_e) > dis(u, x) + dis(x, t)$ where $x \in P$, contradiction.
    Thus, the claim is true.
\end{proof}
In This case, the ending point of the first bfs must be the starting node of the longest path, all we need is another bfs.
